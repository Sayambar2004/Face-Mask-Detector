    This mask detection model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The architecture consists of:
    
    - **Input Layer**: 128x128x3 RGB images.
    - **Three Convolutional Layers**: 
      - First Conv2D layer with 32 filters and a kernel size of 3x3, followed by MaxPooling and 25% dropout.
      - Second Conv2D layer with 64 filters and a kernel size of 3x3, followed by MaxPooling and 25% dropout.
      - Third Conv2D layer with 128 filters and a kernel size of 3x3, followed by MaxPooling and 25% dropout.
    - **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 3D output of the last Conv2D layer into a 1D array.
    - **Dense Layer**: A fully connected Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation, followed by 50% dropout.
    - **Output Layer**: A Dense layer with 1 unit and Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
    
    ### Additional Technical Details:
    - **Activation Function**: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used in hidden layers to introduce non-linearity. Sigmoid activation is used in the final layer for binary classification.
    - **Dropout**: Dropout layers are added after each pooling and dense layer to prevent overfitting. Dropout rates are 25% for convolutional layers and 50% before the output layer.
    - **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy is used because this is a binary classification problem (mask/no mask).
    - **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer is used for efficient gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.001.
    - **Early Stopping**: Early stopping was applied to monitor validation loss and prevent overfitting. Training stops if the validation loss doesnâ€™t improve after 5 consecutive epochs.
    - **Data Augmentation**: To improve model robustness, the training data was augmented with random rotations, width/height shifts, shear, zoom, and horizontal flips.
    
    ### Model Performance:
    - **Accuracy**: 95.15% on the training data, and 97.02% on the validation set.
    - **Loss**: The final training loss was 0.1434, while the validation loss was 0.0948.
    
    ### Training Process:
    - The model was trained for 20 epochs using the Adam optimizer and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation helped to generalize the model by introducing variations in the training data.
